# Visual algorithms

This repo consists of different types of algorithms which I show them visually such ad insertion sort, selection sort and so on. Additionally I use the random queue to make a maze and solve it by  DFS and BFS.

## Sort

1. Selection sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort includes the two ways quick sort and three ways quick sort
5. Heap sort

The following picture is merge sort:
